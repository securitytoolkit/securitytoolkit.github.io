If the service DACL (not the service's executable DACL) allow you to modify the configuration of a service, you will be able to reconfigure the service. From the AccessChk output you must verify whether OWNER has higher permission than ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE, if you have control over ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE you can perform privesc by changing executable of service. This will allow you to point to any executable you need and run it with any account you prefer, including SYSTEM itself.
