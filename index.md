![logo](https://securitytoolkit.github.io/assets/logo.png){:.logo}

This toolkit is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a useful list of (mostly offensive) security tools to be used in penetration testing or red teaming exercises. The tools were collected from Github repositories and other several public sources. See the tool categories on [items](https://securitytoolkit.github.io/items/).

I relied heavily on [WADComs'][WADComs] site template to make this one.
