# A Security Toolkit

Security Toolkit is an interactive cheat sheet, containing an useful list of offensive security tools.

This project was based on the creation of John Woodman and was inspired by GTFOBins, LOLBAS and ARTToolkit. I relied heavily on WADComs site template to make this one. Credits to original authors.
